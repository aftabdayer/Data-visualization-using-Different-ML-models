# Data-Visualisation
Information Retrieval Project

This project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of various classification models trained on a medical EEG dataset, to tell which model is better at retrieving information from unseen dataset.
I created generic modules which take in any dataset and visualize the model performances. You can use different datasets and compare the performace of various classification models used here.

# Classification models used here:
### Gaussian Naive Bayes 
### K Neighbours 
### Logistic Regression
### Random Forest
### Decision Tree
### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
